# Using Events with the QueryTable Object

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Before you can use events with the  **QueryTable** object, you must first create a class module and declare a **QueryTable** object with events. For example, assume that you have created a class module and named it `ClsModQT`. This module contains the following code:




```
Public WithEvents qtQueryTable As QueryTable
```

After you have declared the new object by using events, it appears in the  **Object** drop-down list box in the class module.
Before the procedures will run, however, you must connect the declared object in the class module to the specified  **QueryTable** object. You can do this by entering the following code in the class module:



```
Sub InitQueryEvent(QT as Object) 
 Set qtQueryTable = QT 
End Sub
```

After you run this initialization procedure, the object you declared in the class module points to the specified  **QueryTable** object. You can initialize the event in a module by calling the event. In this example, the first query table on the active worksheet is connected to the `qtQueryTable` object.



```
Dim clsQueryTable as New ClsModQT 
 
Sub RunInitQTEvent 
 clsQueryTable.InitQueryEvent _ 
 QT:=ActiveSheet.QueryTables(1) 
End Sub
```

You can write other event procedures in the object's class. When you click the new object in the  **Object** box, the valid events for that object are displayed in the **Procedure** drop-down list box.
