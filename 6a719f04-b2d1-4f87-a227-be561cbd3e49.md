# FuncFib

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Example user-defined worksheet function that computes the Nth Fibonacci number. When GENERIC.xll is loaded, it registers this function so that it can be called from the worksheet.


```C#

LPXLOPER12 WINAPI FuncFib (LPXLOPER12 pxN);
```


## Parameters

pxN ( **LPXLOPER12**)

The value of N for which the Nth Fibonacci number is required.


## Property Value/Return Value

( **xltypeNum LPXLOPER12** if successful or **xltypeErr** otherwise)

The Nth Fibonacci number.


## Remarks

The function uses a static variable defined within the function block as the return value  **XLOPER12**. This is not thread safe, and so this function, and any worksheet function that uses this strategy for returning  **XLOPER**s or  **XLOPER12**s, should not be registered as thread safe starting in Excel 2007.


### Example

See  `\SAMPLES\GENERIC\GENERIC.C` for the source code for this function.
