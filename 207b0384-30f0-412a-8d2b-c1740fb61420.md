   'Using the email, add multiple recipients, using a list of addresses in column A.
   With olMailItm
       SDest = ""
       For iCounter = 1 To WorksheetFunction.CountA(Columns(1))

           End If
       Next iCounter
       
    'Do additional formatting on the BCC and Subject lines, add the body text from the spreadsheet, and send.
