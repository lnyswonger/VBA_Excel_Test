# DisplayRSquared Property

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

 **True** if the R-squared value of the trendline is displayed on the chart (in the same data label as the equation). Setting this property to **True** automatically turns on data labels. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Example

This example displays the R-squared value and equation for trendline one. The example should be run on a 2-D column chart that has a trendline for the first series.


```
With myChart.SeriesCollection(1).Trendlines(1) 
 .DisplayRSquared = True 
 .DisplayEquation = True 
End With
```
