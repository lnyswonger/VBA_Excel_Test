# AllowEditRanges Object (Excel)

A collection of all the  ** [AllowEditRange](2bfd80d1-3a59-162e-194a-8699ca6b0d4b.md)** objects that represent the cells that can be edited on a protected worksheet.


## Remarks

Use the  ** [AllowEditRanges](829ec57c-2fe1-27b0-5987-83bd4dd50eed.md)** property of the ** [Protection](dc13a9dd-bd19-daa2-5093-7182917d5bde.md)** object to return an **AllowEditRanges** collection.

Once an  **AllowEditRanges** collection has been returned, you can use the ** [Add](f88d900d-4974-4d8d-6279-0be6376fc232.md)** method to add a range that can be edited on a protected worksheet.


## Example

In this example, Microsoft Excel allows edits to range "A1:A4" on the active worksheet and notifies the user of the title and address of the specified range.


```
Sub UseAllowEditRanges() 
 
 Dim wksOne As Worksheet 
 Dim wksPassword As String 
 
 Set wksOne = Application.ActiveSheet 
 
 ' Unprotect worksheet. 
 wksOne.Unprotect 
 
 wksPassword = InputBox ("Enter password for the worksheet") 
 
 ' Establish a range that can allow edits 
 ' on the protected worksheet. 
 wksOne.Protection.AllowEditRanges.Add _ 
 Title:="Classified", _ 
 Range:=Range("A1:A4"), _ 
 Password:=wksPassword 
 
 ' Notify the user 
 ' the title and address of the range. 
 With wksOne.Protection.AllowEditRanges.Item(1) 
 MsgBox "Title of range: " &amp; .Title 
 MsgBox "Address of range: " &amp; .Range.Address 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
