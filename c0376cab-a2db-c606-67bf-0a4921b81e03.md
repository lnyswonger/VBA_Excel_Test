If set to  **False**, the workbook is not sent. If omitted, the user is asked whether the workbook should be sent.|

## Remarks

Closing a workbook from Visual Basic doesn't run any Auto_Close macros in the workbook. Use the  ** [RunAutoMacros](85dfdadf-75e6-437d-fb7a-e17681a69b35.md)**method to run the auto close macros.


## Example

This example closes Book1.xls and discards any changes that have been made to it.


```
Workbooks("BOOK1.XLS").Close SaveChanges:=False
```
