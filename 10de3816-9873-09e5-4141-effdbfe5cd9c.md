# Application.CalculationVersion Property (Excel)

Returns a number whose rightmost four digits are the minor calculation engine version number, and whose other digits (on the left) are the major version of Microsoft Excel. Read-only  **Long**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **CalculationVersion**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.

 blnFullCalc = True 
Else 
 blnFullCalc = False 
End If
```
