# Offset Property

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Returns or sets the distance between each of the levels of labels, and the distance between the first level and the axis line. The default is 100, which represents the spacing between the axis labels and axis line. The value can be an integer from 0 to 1000, relative to the size of the font of the axis label. Read/write  **Long**.


## Example

This example doubles the existing tick-mark spacing on the value axis in myChart, if the offset is less than 500.


```
With myChart.Axes(xlCategory).TickLabels 
 If .Offset < 500 then 
 .Offset = .Offset * 2 
 End If 
End With 

```
