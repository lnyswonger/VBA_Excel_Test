# PivotTable.TotalsAnnotation Property (Excel)

 **True** if an asterisk (*) is displayed next to each subtotal and grand total value in the specified PivotTable report if the report is based on an OLAP data source. The default value is **True**. Read/write  **Boolean**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **TotalsAnnotation**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PivotTable** object.


## Remarks

When this property is set to  **True**, the asterisk indicates that hidden items are included in the total. The asterisk appears regardless of whether any items in the report have been hidden.

For non-OLAP data sources, the value of this property is always  **False**.


## Example

This example turns off the asterisks in the first PivotTable report on the active worksheet.


```
ActiveSheet.PivotTables(1).TotalsAnnotation = False
```
