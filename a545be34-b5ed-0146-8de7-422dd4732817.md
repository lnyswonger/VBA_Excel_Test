To add  [controls](a85149e1-459e-f83b-3171-467a7e29ca28.md)to a user form, find the control you want to add in the  **Toolbox**, drag the control onto the form, and then drag an adjustment handle on the control until the control's outline is the size and shape you want.


**Note**  Dragging a control, or a number of "grouped" controls from the form back to the  **Toolbox** creates a template of the controls, which can be reused. This is a useful feature for implementing a standard interface for your applications.

After you have added controls to the form, use the commands on the  **Format** menu in the Visual Basic Editor to adjust the control alignment and spacing.
