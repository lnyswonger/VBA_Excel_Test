# LeaderLines Object

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Represents leader lines in the specified chart. Leader lines connect data labels to data points. This object isn't a collection; there's no object that represents a single leader line.


## Using the LeaderLines Object

Use the  ** [LeaderLines](ddd9ab86-d135-73de-b888-3ba43c39ece8.md)**property to return the  **LeaderLines** object. The following example adds data labels and blue leader lines to series one in the chart.


```
With myChart.SeriesCollection(1) 
 .HasDataLabels = True 
 .DataLabels.Position = xlLabelPositionBestFit 
 .HasLeaderLines = True 
 .LeaderLines.Border.ColorIndex = 5 
End With
```
