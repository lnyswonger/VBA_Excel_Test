# C API Callback Functions Excel4, Excel12

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

The  **Excel4** and **Excel12** functions are provided to enable DLLs to call an internal Microsoft Excel worksheet function, macro sheet function or command, or XLL-only special function or command. All recent versions of Excel support the **Excel4** function. Starting in Excel 2007 the **Excel12** function is supported. Both functions are provided in two forms:


- A variable-length argument list form ( **Excel4/Excel12**)
    
- An array-of-arguments form ( **Excel4v/Excel12v**)
    
Except for the way in which arguments are passed to these callbacks, the two forms are functionally equivalent. The basic concepts for both forms are fully described in  [Excel4/Excel12](2404f10d-8641-4ee6-a909-1c5a26610f80.md).  [Excel4v/Excel12v](e3e96b98-c5a7-4625-95b6-a1e2d09c6d3d.md) covers other issues about this form.
