# xlfRegister (Form 2)

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Can be called from a DLL or XLL command that has itself been called by Microsoft Excel. This is equivalent to calling  **REGISTER** from an Excel XLM macro sheet.

The  **xlfRegister** function can be called in two forms:

-  [xlfRegister (Form 1)](c730124c-1886-4a0f-8f06-79763025537d.md): Registers an individual command or function.
    
- xlfRegister (Form 2): Loads and activates an XLL.
    
Called in Form 2, this function can only be used to load and activate an XLL containing an  [xlAutoOpen](748cecb6-61d0-496b-a1a4-a73d22eb29e2.md) procedure.

```C#

Excel12(xlfRegister, LPXLOPER12 pxRes, 1, LPXLOPER12 pxModuleText);
```


## Parameters

pxModuleText ( **xltypeStr**)

The name of the DLL to be loaded and activated.


## Property Value/Return Value

If successful, this returns the name of the DLL ( **xltypeStr**). Otherwise it returns a #VALUE! error.
