 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Used to return a handle for data saved by the  [xlDefineBinaryName function](e3e8f91b-cc31-4f09-9941-f950ae96820a.md). Data with a defined binary name is saved with the workbook and can be accessed by name at any time. For more information, see "Binary name Scope Limitation" in  [Known Issues in Excel XLL Development](3dfecc0b-a91c-448e-8721-5d3486b625fa.md).


```C#

Excel12(xlGetBinaryName, LPXLOPER12 pxRes, 1, LPXLOPER12 pxName);
```


## Parameters

pxRes ( **xltypeBigData** or **xltypeErr**)

Bigdata structure specifying the retrieved data or an error is the data could not be retrieved or the name is not defined. When the function returns, the  **hdata** member of the **XLOPER**/ **XLOPER12** contains a handle for the named data.pxRes should be freed in a call to **xlFree** when no longer required.

pxName ( **xltypeStr**)

A string specifying the name of the data.


## Remarks

Microsoft Excel owns the memory handle returned in  **hdata**. In Windows, the handle is a global memory handle (allocated by the  **GlobalAlloc** function).
