# Research Object (Excel)

Represents the controls of a  **Research** query.


## Remarks

When working with  **Research** queries, you must have an existing GUID that corresponds to a live data source. If the data source is unavailable or does not exist, a run-time error occurs.


## Example

The following example returns data from an existing data source and translates the information into working content.


```
Worksheets("Sheet1").Research.Translate = True
```
