 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Conversion routine used to convert from the new  **XLOPER12** to the old **XLOPER**.


```C#

BOOL XLOper12ToXLOper(LPXLOPER12 pxloper12, LPXLOPER pxloper);
```


## Parameters

pxloper12 ( **LPXLOPER12**)

Pointer to the source  **XLOPER12** to be converted.

pxloper ( **LPXLOPER**)

Pointer to the target  **XLOPER** to contain the converted value.


## Property Value/Return Value

 **TRUE** if the conversion succeeded, **FALSE** otherwise.


## Remarks

Depending on the type of the  **XLOPER12**, this function allocates a new memory buffer for the converted values, which are pointed to in the target  **XLOPER**. The caller is responsible for freeing any memory associated with the copy if the conversion is a success;  **FreeXLOperT** can be used, or it can be done directly by using **free**.

If the conversion fails, the caller does not need to free any memory.

Conversion from an  **XLOPER12** to an **XLOPER** can fail when the **XLOPER12** contains an array or reference that is too large or a string that is too long for the **XLOPER** to contain.

 **XLOPER12** Unicode wide-character strings are converted to **XLOPER** ASCII byte strings in a way that is locale-dependent.

The  **XLOPER12** **xltypeInt** is a 32-bit signed integer, whereas the **XLOPER** **xltypeInt** is a 16-bit signed integer. When a supplied **XLOPER12** integer exceeds the limit of an **XLOPER** integer, the integer is converted to an 8-byte double and returned in an **XLOPER** of type **xltypeNum**. This is the only case in which this function changes the type of the converted  **XLOPER**.


### Example

See the file  `\SAMPLES\FRAMEWRK\FRAMEWRK.C` for the code for this function.
