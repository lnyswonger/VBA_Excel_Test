# How to: Refer to All the Cells on the Worksheet

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

When you apply the  **Cells** property to a worksheet without specifying an index number, the method returns a **Range** object that represents all the cells on the worksheet. The following **Sub** procedure clears the contents from all the cells on Sheet1 in the active workbook.




```
Sub ClearSheet() 
 Worksheets("Sheet1").Cells.ClearContents 
End Sub
```
