Represents the plot area of the specified chart. This is the area where your chart data is plotted. The plot area in a 2-D chart contains the data markers, gridlines, data labels, trendlines, and optional chart items placed in the chart area. The plot area in a 3-D chart contains all the above items plus the walls, floor, axes, axis titles, and tick-mark labels in the chart.

The plot area is surrounded by the chart area. The chart area in a 2-D chart contains the axes, the chart title, the axis titles, and the legend. The chart area in a 3-D chart contains the chart title and the legend. For information about formatting the chart area, see the  ** [ChartArea](85fcf460-6b2b-142f-ce4a-4a74e9d8efd3.md)**object.
