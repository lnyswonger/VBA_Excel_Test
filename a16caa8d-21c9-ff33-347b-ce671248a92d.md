A common task when using Visual Basic is to specify a cell or range of cells and then do something with it, such as enter a formula or change the format. You can usually do this in one statement that identifies the range and also changes a property or applies a method.

A  **Range** object in Visual Basic can be either a single cell or a range of cells. The following topics show the most common ways to identify and work with **Range** objects.
