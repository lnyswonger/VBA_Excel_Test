# xlSheetId

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Finds the sheet ID of a named sheet in order to construct external references.


```C#

Excel12(xlSheetId, LPXLOPER12 pxRes, 1, LPXLOPER12 pxSheetName);
```


## Parameters

pxSheetName ( **xltypeStr**)

(Optional). The name of the book and sheet you want to find out about. If omitted, the  **xlSheetId** function returns the sheet ID of the active (front) sheet.


## Return value

Returns the sheet ID in pxRes->val.mref.idSheet. 


**Note**  The pxRes->val.mref.lpmref array pointer is set to NULL after this call so that there is no need to call **xlFree** to release the memory that this type normally contains, although it is completely safe to do so.


## Remarks

The workbook containing the specified sheet must be open to use this function. There is no way to construct a reference to an unopened workbook from a DLL. For more information about using  **xlSheetId** to construct references, see [Memory Management in Excel](3bf5195b-6235-43cf-8795-0c7b0a63a095.md) for examples of **xltypeRef** construction.


## Example

 `\SAMPLES\EXAMPLE\EXAMPLE.C`


```C#
short WINAPI xlSheetIdExample(void)
{       
   XLOPER12 xSheetName, xRes;

   xSheetName.xltype = xltypeStr;
   xSheetName.val.str = L"\022[BOOK1.XLSX]Sheet1";
   Excel12(xlSheetId, &amp;xRes, 1, (LPXLOPER12)&amp;xSheetName);
   Excel12f(xlcAlert, 0, 1, TempNum12(xRes.val.mref.idSheet));
   Excel12(xlFree, 0, 1, (LPXLOPER12)&amp;xRes);
   return 1;
}
```
