# ShapeRange.Ungroup Method (Excel)

Ungroups any grouped shapes in the specified shape or range of shapes. Disassembles pictures and OLE objects within the specified shape or range of shapes.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Ungroup**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **ShapeRange** object.


### Return Value

A  ** [ShapeRange](e1b8229c-73a0-4a77-5e00-4bcec9032260.md)** object that represents the ungrouped shapes.


## Remarks

Because a group of shapes is treated as a single object, grouping and ungrouping shapes changes the number of items in the  **Shapes** collection and changes the index numbers of items that come after the affected items in the collection.


## Example

This example ungroups any grouped shapes and disassembles any pictures or OLE objects on  `myDocument`.


```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
For Each s In myDocument.Shapes 
 s.Ungroup 
Next
```

This example ungroups any grouped shapes on  `myDocument` without disassembling pictures or OLE objects on the document.




```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
For Each s In myDocument.Shapes 
 If s.Type = msoGroup Then s.Ungroup
```
