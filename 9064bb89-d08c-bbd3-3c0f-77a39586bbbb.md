# Pane Object (Excel)

Represents a pane of a window.


## Remarks

 **Pane** objects exist only for worksheets and Microsoft Excel 4.0 macro sheets. The **Pane** object is a member of the ** [Panes](ce27ae27-52d9-9e51-a068-b9c082a0a692.md)** collection. The **Panes** collection contains all of the panes shown in a single window.


## Example

Use  ** [Panes](ba89f562-66f8-990d-e034-c996557b3687.md)**( _index_), where  _index_ is the pane index number, to return a single **Pane** object. The following example splits the window in which worksheet one is displayed and then scrolls through the pane in the lower-left corner until row five is at the top of the pane.


```
Worksheets(1).Activate 
ActiveWindow.Split = True 
ActiveWindow.Panes(3).ScrollRow = 5
```
