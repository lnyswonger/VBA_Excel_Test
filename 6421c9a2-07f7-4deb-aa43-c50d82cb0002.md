# CallUDF

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Calls a user-defined function in a high-performance computing environment.


```
int CallUDF(int SessionId, WCHAR *XllName, WCHAR *UDFName, LPXLOPER12 pxAsyncHandle, int (*CallBackAddr)(), int ArgCount, LPXLOPER12 Parameter1, ...)
```


## Parameters


- SessionIdThe ID of the session in which to make the call.
    
- XLLNameThe name of the XLL that contains the user-defined function.
    
- UDFNameThe name of the user-defined function.
    
- CallBackAddrThe function that the connector should call when the user-defined function is finished.
    
- pxAsyncHandleThe asynchronous handle used by Excel and the connector to track the pending user-defined function call. The connector uses it later when the call is finished, when it calls back into Excel using the function pointer passed in the CallBackAddr argument.
    
- ArgCountThe number of arguments to pass to the user-defined function. The maximum value allowed is 255.
    
- Parameter1A value to pass to the user-defined function. Repeat this argument for each parameter indicated by ArgCount.
    

## Return Value

 **xlHpcRetSuccess** if the UDF call is successfully initiated; **xlHpcRetInvalidSessionId** if theSessionId argument is invalid; **xlHpcRetCallFailed** on other failures, including time-out. If the call returns any error code (anything except **xlHpcRetSuccess**), then Excel considers the UDF call to have failed, invalidates the pxAsyncHandle, and does not expect a callback to occur.


## Remarks

This function executes asynchronously.
