# Elevation Property

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Returns or sets the elevation of the 3-D chart view, in degrees. Read/write  **Long**.


## Remarks

The chart elevation is the height at which you view the chart, in degrees. The default is 15 for most chart types. The value of this property must be between -90 and 90, except for 3-D bar charts, where it must be between 0 and 44.


## Example

This example sets the chart elevation to 34 degrees. The example should be run on a 3-D chart (the  **Elevation** property fails on 2-D charts).


```
myChart.Elevation = 34
```
