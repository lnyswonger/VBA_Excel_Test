# PublishObject.Source Property (Excel)

Returns a  **Variant** value that represents the unique name that identifies items that have a ** [SourceType](4d22915d-c5a3-c06f-85dc-3c6394644cec.md)** property value of **xlSourceRange**,  **xlSourceChart**,  **xlSourcePrintArea**,  **xlSourceAutoFilter**,  **xlSourcePivotTable**, or  **xlSourceQuery**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Source**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PublishObject** object.


## Remarks

If the  **SourceType** property is set to **xlSourceRange**, this property returns a range, which can be a defined name. If the  **SourceType** property is set to **xlSourceChart**,  **xlSourcePivotTable**, or  **xlSourceQuery**, this property returns the name of the object, such as a chart name, a PivotTable report name, or a query table name.


## Example

This example determines the unique name of the first chart (in the first workbook) saved as a Web page, and then it sets the  **Boolean** variable `blnChartFound` to **True**. If no items in the document have been saved as Chart components,  `blnChartFound` is **False**.


```
blnChartFound = False 
For Each objPO In Workbooks(1).PublishObjects 
 If objPO.SourceType = xlSourceChart Then 
 strFirstPO = objPO.Source 
 blnChartFound = True 
 Exit For 
 End If 
Next objPO
```
