# DepthPercent Property

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Returns or sets the depth of a 3-D chart as a percentage of the chart width (between 20 and 2000 percent). Read/write  **Long**.


## Example

This example sets the depth of the chart to be 50 percent of its width. The example should be run on a 3-D chart (the  **DepthPercent** property fails on 2-D charts).


```
myChart.DepthPercent = 50
```
