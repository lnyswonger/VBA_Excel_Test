# Application.PreviousSelections Property (Excel)

Returns an array of the last four ranges or names selected. Each element in the array is a  ** [Range](b8207778-0dcc-4570-1234-f130532cc8cd.md)**object. Read-only  **Variant**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **PreviousSelections**( **_Index_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Index|Optional| **Variant**|The index number (from 1 to 4) of the previous range or name.|

## Remarks

Each time you go to a range or cell by using the  **Name** box or the **Go To** command ( **Edit** menu), or each time a macro calls the ** [Goto](ce60e6d4-18e5-056c-229e-8c0b730109ae.md)**method, the previous range is added to this array as element number 1, and the other items in the array are moved down.


## Example

This example displays the cell addresses of all items in the array of previous selections. If there are no previous selections, the  **LBound** function returns an error. This error is trapped, and a message box appears.


```
On Error GoTo noSelections 
For i = LBound(Application.PreviousSelections) To _ 
 UBound(Application.PreviousSelections) 
 MsgBox Application.PreviousSelections(i).Address 
Next i 
Exit Sub 
On Error GoTo 0 
 
noSelections: 
 MsgBox "There are no previous selections"
```
