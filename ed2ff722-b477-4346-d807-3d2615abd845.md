 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Returns a  ** [HiLoLines](6793025e-0b3e-360c-4292-02397395535a.md)**object that represents the high-low lines for the specified series on a line chart. Applies only to line charts. Read-only.

```
With myChart.ChartGroups(1) 
 .HasHiLoLines = True 
 With .HiLoLines.Border 
 .LineStyle = xlThin 
 .Weight = xlMedium 
 .ColorIndex = 3 
 End With 
End With
```
