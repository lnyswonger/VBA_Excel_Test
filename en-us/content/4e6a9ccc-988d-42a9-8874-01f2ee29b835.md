# Excel/Excel12f

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Framework library functions.  **Excel** is a wrapper for the [Excel4](2404f10d-8641-4ee6-a909-1c5a26610f80.md) function. **Excel12f** is a wrapper for the [Excel12](2404f10d-8641-4ee6-a909-1c5a26610f80.md) function. Each checks to see that none of the arguments is zero, which would indicate that the creation of a temporary **XLOPER** or **XLOPER12** failed. If an error occurs, each prints a debug message. When finished, each frees all temporary memory that might have been created for temporary **XLOPER**s and  **XLOPER12**s.

 **Excel12f** can only be called from a DLL starting with the Excel 2007 C API library. Furthermore, it only works when running starting with Excel 2007, and fails with **xlretFailed** otherwise.

```C#

int Excel(int iFunction, LPXLOPER pxRes, int iCount, 
LPXLOPER argument1, ...);
int Excel12f(int iFunction, LPXLOPER12 pxRes, int iCount, 
LPXLOPER12 argument1, ...);
```


## Parameters

iFunction ( **int**)

A number indicating the command or function you want to call. For more information, see  [Excel4/Excel12](2404f10d-8641-4ee6-a909-1c5a26610f80.md).

pxRes

A pointer to result of the evaluated function. Any memory pointed to in the result will have been allocated by Excel and should be freed in a call to  [xlFree](8ce2eef2-0138-495d-b6cb-bbb727a3cda4.md) once it is no longer needed, or by setting **xlbitXLFree** if returning it to Excel.

iCount ( **int**)

The number of arguments that will be passed to the function. Starting in Excel 2007, the limit is 255 arguments. In earlier versions, the limit is 30.

argument1, ...

The optional arguments to the function. All arguments must be pointers to  **XLOPER**s in the case of  **Excel**, or  **XLOPER12**s in the case of  **Excel12f**.


## Return value

Both functions return the same error and success codes as  **Excel4**,  **Excel4v**,  **Excel12**, and  **Excel12v**. See  [Excel4/Excel12](2404f10d-8641-4ee6-a909-1c5a26610f80.md) for a full description of these codes. In addition, these Framework functions return **xlretFailed** without calling the C API if a NULL pointer to a parameter is detected.


## Example

This example passes a bad argument to the  **Excel12f** function, which sends a message to the debugger.

 `\SAMPLES\EXAMPLE\EXAMPLE.C`




```C#
short WINAPI Excel12fExample(void)
{
    Excel12f(xlcDisplay, 0, 1, 0);
    return 1;
}
```
