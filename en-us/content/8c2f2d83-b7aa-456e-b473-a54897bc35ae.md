# fDance

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Example user-defined command that changes the selected cells on the active worksheet around until the user presses  **ESC**. When GENERIC.xll is loaded, it creates a user-defined menu, Generic, through which this command is accessed.


```C#

int WINAPI fDance(void);
```


## Parameters

The function takes no parameters.


## Property Value/Return Value

The function always returns 1.


## Remarks

This is an example of a lengthy operation. It calls the function  [xlAbort](0fe71454-6b00-464b-8abf-afb209d57754.md) occasionally. This yields the processor (helping with cooperative multitasking), and checks whether the user has pressed **ESC** to cancel the operation. If so, it offers the user a chance to cancel the abort.


### Example

See  `\SAMPLES\GENERIC\GENERIC.C` for the source code for this function.
