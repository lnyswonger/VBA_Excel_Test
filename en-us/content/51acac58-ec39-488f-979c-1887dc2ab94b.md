# ShowOptions

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Shows a modal dialog box to collect information from the user. This entry point is called when a user clicks the  **Options** button next to the **Cluster type** box for the selected cluster connector in the **Excel Options** dialog box (in the **Advanced** category under the **Formulas** section). Cluster connectors are responsible for implementing their own options dialog interface and for storing the related data in the registry or elsewhere. The options are internal to the cluster connector. Excel is not aware of them.


```C#
int ShowOptions(HWND hWndParent)
```


## Parameters


- hWndParentA handle to the Excel window.
    

## Return Value

 **xlHpcRetSuccess** if the dialog box was shown; **xlHpcRetCallFailed** if it was not shown.


## Remarks

Cluster connectors can use this dialog box to get information, such as what cluster server to use, from the user.
