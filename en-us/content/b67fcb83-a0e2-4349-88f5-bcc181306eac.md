# Handling Events

 **Last modified:** April 19, 2012

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Starting in Excel 2010, XLLs can receive events designed to manage the asynchronous function life cycle. The events are as follows:


-  **CalculationEnded**: Raised when Excel is finished calculating. After this event, you can free resources allocated during the calculation.
    
-  **CalculationCanceled**: Raised when the user interrupts the calculation. The XLL stops any asynchronous activities. Immediately following this event, the  **CalculationEnded** event is raised.
    
To handle these events, the XLL uses the C API function  [xlEventRegister](b98637d4-02e3-4dbd-8be5-6b46d32980c6.md). 

**Note**   **CalculationEnded** and **CalculationCanceled** are not raised during programmatic recalculation.
