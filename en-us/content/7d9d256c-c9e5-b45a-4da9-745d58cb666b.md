# Initializing Control Properties

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

You can initialize  [controls](a85149e1-459e-f83b-3171-467a7e29ca28.md)at run time by using Visual Basic code in a macro. For example, you could fill a list box, set text values, or set option buttons.

The following example uses the  **AddItem** method to add data to a list box. Then it sets the value of a text box and displays the form.



```
Private Sub GetUserName() 
 With UserForm1 
 .lstRegions.AddItem "North" 
 .lstRegions.AddItem "South" 
 .lstRegions.AddItem "East" 
 .lstRegions.AddItem "West" 
 .txtSalesPersonID.Text = "00000" 
 .Show 
 ' ... 
 End With 
End Sub
```

You can also use code in the  **Initialize** event of a form to set initial values for controls on the form. An advantage to setting initial control values in the **Initialize** event is that the initialization code stays with the form. You can copy the form to another project, and when you run the **Show** method to display the dialog box, the controls will be initialized.



```
Private Sub UserForm_Initialize() 
 UserForm1.lstNames.AddItem "Test One" 
 UserForm1.lstNames.AddItem "Test Two" 
 UserForm1.txtUserName.Text = "Default Name" 
End Sub
```
