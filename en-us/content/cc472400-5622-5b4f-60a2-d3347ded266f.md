# Application.WorkbookRowsetComplete Event (Excel)

The  **WorkbookRowsetComplete** event occurs when the user either drills through the recordset or invokes the rowset action on an OLAP PivotTable.


## Version Information

Version Added: Excel 2007 


## Syntax

 _expression_. **WorkbookRowsetComplete**( **_Wb_**,  **_Description_**,  **_Sheet_**,  **_Success_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Wb|Required| **Workbook**|The workbook for which the event occurs.|
|Description|Required| **String**|A brief description of the event.|
|Sheet|Required| **String**|The worksheet on which the recordset is created.|
|Success|Required| **Boolean**|Contains a Boolean value to indicate success or failure.|

## Remarks

Because the recordset is created asynchronously, the event allows automation to determine when the action has been completed. Additionally, because the recordset is created on a separate sheet, the event needs to be on the workbook level.
