 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Represents a single axis in a chart. The  **Axis** object is a member of the ** [Axes](89ebeb9d-3c16-0bb0-35a8-9a07483c4eb6.md)**collection.


## Using the Axis Object

Use  **Axes**( _type_,  _group_), where  _type_ is the axis type and _group_ is the axis group, to return a single **Axis** object. _Type_ can be one of the following **XlAxisType** constants: **xlCategory**,  **xlSeries**, or  **xlValue**.  _Group_ can be either of the following **XlAxisGroup** constants: **xlPrimary** or **xlSecondary**. For more information, see the  ** [Axes](040bf3e2-f60f-935b-9803-6f9bf146bee7.md)**method.

The following example sets the text of the category axis title in the chart.




```
With myChart.Axes(xlCategory) 
 .HasTitle = True 
 .AxisTitle.Caption = "1994" 
End With
```
