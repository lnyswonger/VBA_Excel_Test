The  **SortUsingCustomLists** property controls whether custom lists are used for sorting items of fields, both initially when the PivotField is initialized and the PivotItems are ordered by their captions; and later when the user applies a sort. Read/write **Boolean**.


## Version Information

## Syntax

 _expression_. **SortUsingCustomLists**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PivotTable** object.
