# Working with 3-D Ranges

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

If you are working with the same range on more than one sheet, use the  **Array** function to specify two or more sheets to select. The following example formats the border of a 3-D range of cells.




```
Sub FormatSheets() 
 Sheets(Array("Sheet2", "Sheet3", "Sheet5")).Select 
 Range("A1:H1").Select 
 Selection.Borders(xlBottom).LineStyle = xlDouble 
End Sub
```

The following example applies the  ** [FillAcrossSheets](c006cee2-67a1-2f24-3061-a2eb32ee9ecf.md)**method to transfer the formats and any data from the range on Sheet2 to the corresponding ranges on all the worksheets in the active workbook.



```
Sub FillAll() 
 Worksheets("Sheet2").Range("A1:H1") _ 
 .Borders(xlBottom).LineStyle = xlDouble 
 Worksheets.FillAcrossSheets (Worksheets("Sheet2") _ 
 .Range("A1:H1")) 
End Sub
```
