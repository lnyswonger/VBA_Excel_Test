# Workbook.RevisionNumber Property (Excel)

Returns the number of times the workbook has been saved while open as a shared list. If the workbook is open in exclusive mode, this property returns 0 (zero). Read-only  **Long**.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **RevisionNumber**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Workbook** object.


## Remarks

The  **RevisionNumber** property is updated only when the local copy of the workbook is saved, not when remote copies are saved.


## Example

```
If ActiveWorkbook.RevisionNumber = 0 Then 
 ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs _ 
 filename:=ActiveWorkbook.FullName, _ 
 accessMode:=xlShared, _ 
 conflictResolution:= _ 
 xlOtherSessionChanges 
End If
```
