# PivotField.UseMemberPropertyAsCaption Property (Excel)

This property is used to control whether member property captions are used for PivotItem captions of the PivotField. Read/write  **Boolean**.


## Version Information

Version Added: Excel 2007 


## Syntax

 _expression_. **UseMemberPropertyAsCaption**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **PivotField** object.


## Remarks

If  **UseMemberPropertyAsCaption** is set to **True** for a PivotField, then **MemberPropertyCaption** specifies which member property caption to display. If none is specified, the first member property of that PivotField (in data source order) will be displayed as the caption for items of that PivotField.

If  **UseMemberPropertyAsCaption** is set to **False**, then the regular PivotItem captions are used for the PivotField.

If you try to set  **UseMemberPropertyAsCaption** to **True** for a PivotField with no member properties, a run-time error is returned. For PivotFields with no member properties, the property will always be **False**.
