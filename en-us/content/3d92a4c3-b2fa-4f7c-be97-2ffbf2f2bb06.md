Sub FillCellsFromAbove()
    ' Turn off screen updating to improve performance
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    On Error Resume Next
    ' Look in column A
    With Columns(1)
        ' For blank cells, set them to equal the cell above
        .SpecialCells(xlCellTypeBlanks).Formula = "=R[-1]C"
        'Convert the formula to a value
        .Value = .Value
    End With
