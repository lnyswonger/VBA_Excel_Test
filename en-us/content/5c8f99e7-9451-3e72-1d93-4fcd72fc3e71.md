# SolverReset Function

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Resets all cell selections and constraints in the  **Solver Parameters** dialog box and restores all the settings in the **Solver Options** dialog box to their defaults. Equivalent to clicking **Reset All** in the **Solver Parameters** dialog box. The **SolverReset** function is called automatically when you call the ** [SolverLoad](01d02d97-f2cd-ba89-bfc0-50eab1ffce2f.md)** function, if the **_Merge_** argument is **False** or omitted.


**Note**  The Solver add-in is not enabled by default. Before you can use this function, you must have the Solver add-in enabled and installed. For information about how to do that, see  [Using the Solver VBA Functions](37d0aa49-2e5c-5efe-1c69-b5168af1f231.md). After the Solver add-in is installed, you must establish a reference to the Solver add-in. In the Visual Basic Editor, with a module active, click  **References** on the **Tools** menu, and then select **Solver** under **Available References**. If  **Solver** does not appear under **Available References**, click  **Browse**, and then open Solver.xlam in the \Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\Library\SOLVER subfolder.

 ByChange:=Range("C4:E6") 
SolverAdd CellRef:=Range("F4:F6"), _ 
 Relation:=1, _

SolverAdd CellRef:=Range("C4:E6"), _ 
 Relation:=3, _ 
 FormulaText:=0 
SolverAdd CellRef:=Range("C4:E6"), _ 
 Relation:=4
