# WorksheetFunction.Correl Method (Excel)

Returns the correlation coefficient of the Arg1 andArg2 cell ranges.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Correl**( **_Arg1_**,  **_Arg2_**)

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **WorksheetFunction** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Arg1|Required| **Variant**|A cell range of values.|
|Arg2|Required| **Variant**|A second cell range of values.|

### Return Value

Double


## Remarks

 Use the correlation coefficient to determine the relationship between two properties. For example, you can examine the relationship between a location's average temperature and the use of air conditioners.


- If an array or reference argument contains text, logical values, or empty cells, those values are ignored; however, cells with the value zero are included.
    
- If  _Arg1_ and _Arg2_ have a different number of data points, Correl generates an error.
    
- If either  _Arg1_ or _Arg2_ is empty, or if s (the standard deviation) of their values equals zero, Correl generates an error.
    
- The equation for the correlation coefficient is:
