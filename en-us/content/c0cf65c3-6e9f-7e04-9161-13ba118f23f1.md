# Chart.Previous Property (Excel)

Returns a  ** [Worksheet](182b705e-854a-81cc-a4b0-59b942de55ae.md)** object that represents the next sheet.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Previous**

 _expression_A variable that represents a  **Chart** object.


## Remarks

If the object is a range, this property emulates pressing SHIFT+TAB; unlike the key combination, however, the property returns the previous cell without selecting it.

On a protected sheet, this property returns the previous unlocked cell. On an unprotected sheet, this property always returns the cell immediately to the left of the specified cell.
