# PivotLine Object (Excel)

A  **PivotLine** object is a line of rows or columns in an Excel PivotTable.


## Version Information

Version Added: Excel 2007 


## Remarks

PivotLines contain only visible items, so collapsed children of items and items in hidden levels are not present in the  **PivotLine** collection.

PivotLines always have a PivotItem in all positions. This means that the PivotLines representing subtotals in the PivotTable contain fewer PivotItems than regular PivotLines.
