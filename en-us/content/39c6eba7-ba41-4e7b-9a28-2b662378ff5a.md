# xlfUnregister (Form 2)

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Can be called from a DLL or XLL command that has itself been called by Microsoft Excel. This is equivalent to calling  **UNREGISTER** from an Excel XLM macro sheet.

 **xlfUnregister** can be called in two forms:

- Form 1: Unregisters an individual command or function.
    
- Form 2: Unloads and deactivates an XLL.
    
Called in Form 2, this function forces a DLL or code resource to be unloaded completely. It unregisters all of the functions in a DLL, even if they are currently in use by another macro, no matter what the use count. This function calls  **xlAutoClose**, and then unregisters all the functions in the DLL.

```C#

Excel12(xlfUnregister, LPXLOPER12 pxRes, 1, LPXLOPER12 pxModuleText);
```


## Parameters

pxModuleText ( **xltypeStr**)

The name of the DLL.


## Property Value/Return Value

If successful, returns  **TRUE** ( **xltypeBool**). If unsuccessful, returns  **FALSE**.


## Remarks

 **Note:** Do not call this form of the function from your implementation of the [xlAutoClose](147e46cd-d4d7-49eb-acdc-5a2ebc2fb6c2.md) in an attempt to unregister all of the DLL's resources with one simple function call. This leads to recursive calling of **xlAutoClose** and a stack overflow.


### Remember to Delete Names

If you specified the pxFunctionText argument to **xlfRegister**, when registering the DLL's functions and commands, you must explicitly delete the names by calling  **xlfSetName** for each one, omitting the second argument so that the function no longer appears in the Function Wizard.
