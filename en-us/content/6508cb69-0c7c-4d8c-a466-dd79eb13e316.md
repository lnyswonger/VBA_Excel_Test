 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Removes the  **ExcelCursorProc** that was previously installed by **HookExcelWindow**. This would have been done so that  **ExcelCursorProc** was called before the Microsoft Excel main **WndProc**.


```C#

extern void FAR PASCAL UnhookExcelWindow(HANDLE hWndExcel);
```


## Parameters

hWndExcel ( **HANDLE**)

The Excel main Windows handle.


## Property Value/Return Value

The function does not return a value.


## Remarks

This function restores the Excel default  **WndProc** using **SetWindowLong()** to restore the address that was saved by **HookExcelWindow()**.


### Example

See  `\SAMPLES\GENERIC\GENERIC.C` for the source code for this function.
