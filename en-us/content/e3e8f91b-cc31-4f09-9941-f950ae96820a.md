```


## Parameters

pxName ( **xltypeStr**)

A string specifying the name of the data. The string is subject to the same naming restrictions as defined names.

pxData ( **xltypeBigData**)

Bigdata structure specifying the data to be stored. When you call this function, the  **lpbData** member of the **bigdata** structure should point to the data for which the name is being defined, and the **cbData** member should contain the length of the data in bytes.

If the pxData argument is not specified ( **xltypeMissing**), the named allocation specified by pxName is deleted.
