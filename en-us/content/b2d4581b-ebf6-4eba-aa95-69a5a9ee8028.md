 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Conversion routine used to convert from the old  **XLOPER** to the new **XLOPER12**.


```C#

BOOL XLOperToXLOper12(LPXLOPER pxloper, LPXLOPER12 pxloper12);
```


## Parameters

pxloper ( **LPXLOPER**)

Pointer to the source  **XLOPER** to be converted.

pxloper12 ( **LPXLOPER12**)

Pointer to the target  **XLOPER12** to contain the converted value.


## Property Value/Return Value

 **TRUE** if the conversion succeeded, **FALSE** otherwise.


## Remarks

Depending on the type of the  **XLOPER**, this function allocates a new memory buffer for the converted values, which are pointed to in the target  **XLOPER12**. The caller is responsible for freeing any memory associated with the copy if the conversion is a success;  **FreeXLOper12T** can be used, or it can be done directly using **free**.

If the conversion fails, the caller does not need to free any memory.

In general, conversion from any  **XLOPER** to an **XLOPER12** is possible. In contrast, conversion from an **XLOPER12** to an **XLOPER** can fail when the **XLOPER12** contains an array or reference that is too large or a string that is too long for the **XLOPER** to contain.

 **XLOPER** ASCII byte strings are converted to **XLOPER12** Unicode wide-character strings in a way that is locale-dependent.


### Example

See the file  `\SAMPLES\FRAMEWRK\FRAMEWRK.C` for the code for this function.
