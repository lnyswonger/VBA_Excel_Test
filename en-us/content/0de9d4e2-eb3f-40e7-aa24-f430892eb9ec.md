# CancelOutstandingRequests

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Informs the cluster connector that an Excel calculation has been canceled, and therefore all pending function calls within that session may be cancelled as well (and that Excel does not expect callbacks with their results).


```
int CancelOutstandingRequests(int SessionId)
```


## Parameters


- SessionIDThe ID of the session used by the canceled calculation. This value matches the value returned by  [OpenSession](6cfd3513-800f-4602-b3e6-6430920718d6.md).
    

## Return Value

 **xlHpcRetSuccess** if theSessionId argument is valid; **xlHpcRetInvalidSessionId** if theSessionId argument is invalid; **xlHpcRetCallFailed** on other failures.


## Remarks

Implementers should stop all processes for the session for improved performance, as any results received after this call will be discarded by Excel.
