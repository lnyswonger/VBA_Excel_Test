# Application.Windows Property (Excel)

Returns a  ** [Windows](d5d0e3c9-9132-469c-d033-d29397dacd77.md)**collection that represents all the windows in all the workbooks. Read-only  **Windows** object.


## Syntax

 _expression_. **Windows**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **Application** object.


## Remarks

Using this property without an object qualifier is equivalent to using  `Application.Windows`.

This property returns a collection of both visible and hidden windows.


## Example

This example closes the first open or hidden window in Microsoft Excel.


```
Application.Windows(1).Close
```

This example names window one in the active workbook "Consolidated Balance Sheet." This name is then used as the index to the  **Windows** collection.




```
ActiveWorkbook.Windows(1).Caption = "Consolidated Balance Sheet" 
ActiveWorkbook.Windows("Consolidated Balance Sheet") _ 
 .ActiveSheet.Calculate
```
