# xlAutoAdd

 **Last modified:** July 01, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

Added by Microsoft Excel whenever the user activates the XLL during an Excel session by using the Add-In Manager. This function is not called when Excel starts up and loads a pre-installed add-in.

This function can be used to display a custom dialog box that tells the user that the add-in has been activated, or to read from or write to the registry, or check licensing information, for example.
Excel does not require an XLL to implement and export this function.

```C#

int WINAPI xlAutoAdd(void);
```


## Parameters

This function takes no arguments.


## Property Value/Return Value

Your implementation of this function should return 1. ( **int**).


## Remarks

Use this function if there is anything your XLL needs to do when it is added by the Add-In Manager.


## Example

See  `\SAMPLES\EXAMPLE\EXAMPLE.C` and `\SAMPLES\GENERIC\GENERIC.C` for example implementations of this function. The following code is from `\SAMPLES\EXAMPLE\EXAMPLE.C`.


```C#
int WINAPI xlAutoAdd(void)
{
    XCHAR szBuf[255];

    wsprintfW((LPWSTR)szBuf, L"Thank you for adding Example.XLL\n"
            L"build date %hs, time %hs",__DATE__, __TIME__);

/* Display a dialog indicating that the XLL was successfully added */
    Excel12f(xlcAlert, 0, 2, TempStr12(szBuf), TempInt12(2));
    return 1;
}
```
