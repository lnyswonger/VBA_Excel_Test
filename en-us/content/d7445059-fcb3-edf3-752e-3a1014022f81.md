When you open a workbook using the  ** [Open](1d1c3fca-ae1a-0a91-65a2-6f3f0fb308a0.md)**method, it becomes a member of the  ** [Workbooks](f768da57-013a-e652-0f5d-60b03aa4240a.md)**collection. The following procedure opens a workbook named MyBook.xls located in the folder named MyFolder on drive C.




```
Sub OpenUp() 
 Workbooks.Open("C:\MyFolder\MyBook.xls") 
End Sub
```
