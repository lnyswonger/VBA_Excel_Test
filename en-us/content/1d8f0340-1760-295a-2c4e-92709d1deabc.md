# DisplayUnitLabel Object

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Represents a unit label on the value axis in the specified chart. Unit labels are useful for charting large valuesâ€”for example, numbers in the millions or billions. You can make the chart more readable by using a single unit label instead of large numbers with strings of zeros next to the tick marks on the axis. This way, you need never have numbers of more than one or two digits by the tick marks.


## Using the DisplayUnitLabel Object

Use the  ** [DisplayUnitLabel](50e91894-9b5d-c915-e94c-e4563b54487a.md)**property to return the  **DisplayUnitLabel** object. The following example sets the caption for the value axis in myChart to "Millions" and turns off automatic font scaling.


```
With myChart.Axes(xlValue).DisplayUnitLabel 
 .Caption = "Millions" 
 .AutoScaleFont = False 
End With
```
