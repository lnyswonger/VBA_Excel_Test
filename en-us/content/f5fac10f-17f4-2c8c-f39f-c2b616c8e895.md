# Using Events with Excel Objects

 **Last modified:** July 19, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

You can write event procedures in Microsoft Excel at the worksheet, chart, query table, workbook, or application level. For example, the  **Activate** event occurs at the sheet level, and the **SheetActivate** event is available at both the workbook and application levels. The **SheetActivate** event for a workbook occurs when any sheet in the workbook is activated. At the application level, the **SheetActivate** event occurs when any sheet in any open workbook is activated.

 [Worksheet](512e329c-92f6-a8e0-8564-b3ba57e8c296.md),  [Chart](6808dfde-94d0-afb0-b245-44d8d1d6241e.md), and  [Workbook](dce102a3-25de-3ff4-2ce5-bc56e08baca7.md) event procedures are available for any open sheet or workbook. To write event procedures for an [embedded chart](6808dfde-94d0-afb0-b245-44d8d1d6241e.md), a  ** [QueryTable](70a68226-6040-f762-119c-37db4b3e34d6.md)** object, or an ** [Application](19b73597-5cf9-4f56-8227-b5211f657f6f.md)** object, you must create a new object by using the **WithEvents** keyword in a class module.
Use the  **EnableEvents** property to enable or disable events. For example, using the **Save** method to save a workbook causes the BeforeSave event to occur. You can prevent this by setting the **EnableEvents** property to **False** before you call the **Save** method.

## Example


```
Application.EnableEvents = False 
ActiveWorkbook.Save 
Application.EnableEvents = True
```
