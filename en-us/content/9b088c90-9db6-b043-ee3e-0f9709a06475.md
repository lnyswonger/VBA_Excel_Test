|Arg4|Required| **Double**|Pv - the present value â€” the total amount that a series of future payments is worth now.|
|Arg5|Optional| **Variant**|Fv - the future value, or a cash balance you want to attain after the last payment is made. If fv is omitted, it is assumed to be 0 (zero), that is, the future value of a loan is 0.|

|:-----|:-----|
|0 or omitted|At the end of the period|

Make sure that you are consistent about the units you use for specifying rate and nper. If you make monthly payments on a four-year loan at 12 percent annual interest, use 12%/12 for rate and 4*12 for nper. If you make annual payments on the same loan, use 12% for rate and 4 for nper.
