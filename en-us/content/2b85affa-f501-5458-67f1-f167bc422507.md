# Corners Object

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Represents the corners of the specified 3-D chart. This object isn't a collection.


## Using the Corners Object

Use the  ** [Corners](18e320a0-f138-a727-3205-419e07f4b339.md)**property to return the  **Corners** object. The following example selects the corners of the chart.


```
myChart.Corners.Select
```

If the chart isn't a 3-D chart, the  **Corners** property fails.
