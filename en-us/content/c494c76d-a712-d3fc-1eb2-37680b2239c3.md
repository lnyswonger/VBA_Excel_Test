After you have added  [controls](a85149e1-459e-f83b-3171-467a7e29ca28.md)to your dialog box or document, you add event procedures to determine how the controls respond to user actions.

User forms and controls have a predefined set of events. For example, a command button has a  **Click** event that occurs when the user clicks the command button, and UserForms have an Initialize event that runs when the form is loaded.
To write a control or form event procedure, open a module by double-clicking the form or control, and select the event from the  **Procedure** drop-down list box.
Event procedures include the name of the control. For example, the name of the  **Click** event procedure for a command button named `Command1` is `Command1_Click`.
If you add code to an event procedure and then change the name of the control, your code remains in procedures with the previous name.
For example, assume you add code to the  **Click** event for `Commmand1` and then rename the control to `Command2`. When you double-click  `Command2`, you will not see any code in the  **Click** event procedure. You will need to move code from `Command1_Click` to `Command2_Click`.
To simplify development, it is a good practice to name your controls before writing code.
