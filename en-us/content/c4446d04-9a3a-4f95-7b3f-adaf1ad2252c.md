 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Represents a series in the specified chart. The  **Series** object is a member of the ** [SeriesCollection](c5d00466-f7a1-7e6f-56e4-958901dbe3e3.md)**collection.


## Using the Series Object

Use  **SeriesCollection**( _index_), where  _index_ is the series' index number or name, to return a single **Series** object. The following example sets the color of the interior for series one in the chart.


```
myChart.SeriesCollection(1).Interior.Color = RGB(255, 0, 0)
```

The series index number indicates the order in which the series are added to the chart.  `SeriesCollection(1)` is the first series added to the chart, and is the first series added to the chart, and `SeriesCollection(SeriesCollection.Count)` is the last one added.
