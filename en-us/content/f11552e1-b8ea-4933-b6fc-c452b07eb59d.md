# What's New in the C API for Excel 2013

 **Last modified:** April 19, 2012

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio_

In conjunction with Microsoft Excel 2013, the Microsoft Excel 2013 XLL Software Development Kit (SDK) includes support for the following features.


-  **New Functions**
    
    The Microsoft Excel 2013 XLL SDK supports calling back to all of the new worksheet functions in Excel 2013. For more information about calling Excel 2013 functions, see  [Calling into Excel from the DLL or XLL](616e3def-e4ec-4f3c-bc65-3b92710da1e6.md).
    
-  **Asynchronous User-defined Functions**
    
    Excel 2013 supports calling user-defined functions (UDF) asynchronously, which can improve performance by enabling several calculations to run at the same time. For more information about asynchronous UDFs, see  [Asynchronous User-Defined Functions](142eb27e-fb6f-4da3-bfb7-a88115bbb5d5.md).
    
-  **Cluster Connectors**
    
    Cluster connectors enable UDFs to run on high-performance compute clusters. For more information about creating cluster connectors, see  [Developing Excel 2013 Cluster Connectors](b538ae44-37d2-496b-b6e7-b0e39f6e38cb.md).
    
    **Note**  XLL add-ins that you intend to run on compute clusters must call only cluster-safe functions. For more information about the functions you can use, see  [Excel 2013 XLL SDK API Function Reference](2f6df879-7546-4ac0-a4e3-6b009aee9463.md) and [Cluster Safe Functions](787badaf-8782-454d-a016-7eae83bbd8a9.md).
-  **64-bit Support**
    
    You can now compile and link both 32-bit and 64-bit XLLs. For more information, see  [Creating XLLs](7754998f-4e13-4a37-9724-43b6ee6c919b.md).
