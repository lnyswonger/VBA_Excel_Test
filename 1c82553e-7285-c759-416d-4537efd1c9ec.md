# Floor Property

 **Last modified:** June 30, 2011

 _**Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | VBA_

Returns a  ** [Floor](ce76e68b-7b15-7e2c-4464-07befbf53cc5.md)**object that represents the floor of the 3-D chart. Read-only.


## Example

This example sets the floor color to blue. The example should be run on a 3-D chart (the  **Floor** property fails on 2-D charts).


```
myChart.Floor.Interior.ColorIndex = 5
```
