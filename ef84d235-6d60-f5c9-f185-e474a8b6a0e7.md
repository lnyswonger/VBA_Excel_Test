## Syntax

 _expression_. **IncludeInLayout**

 _expression_A variable that represents an  **AxisTitle** object.

If the user adds a title using the  **Above Chart** command, the chart will resize smaller, as in Microsoft Office Excel 2003. If the user then removes the title or selects one of the overlay title options, the chart will resize larger, as if the title were not on the chart.
